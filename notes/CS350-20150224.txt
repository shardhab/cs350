B-Trees: When we add/subtract, the root does not have to be half full.
All other nodes do.

The alternative to recombining, is to add "tombstones" where you
want to delete stuff, and then perform reindexing later to 
perform all the maintenance at the same time instead of as you go.

In dynamic programming, we just need to keep the last few values
that we will be needing in the next calculation, and we can get rid
of previous values that are not used again.
