Symbol hash: variable length hashing. You take more bits as you need them.

Hash functions have two steps, generally:
1. The hash function
2. A way of compressing the hash function output to fit into the 
hash table size, typically through a modulo function.

Open hash tables use more memory because of all the pointers required
for each word. More than a factor of 2.

The closed hash table could lead to more comparisons because it 
includes not only collisions, but also any other elements that have
been moved into a bucket as a result of a different collision.

In a B+ tree, all the data is in the leaves. In a B tree, the data is also
in the nodes.

If there is data in the nodes, then the tree will not be "as bushy". 
Therefore, there will be less index strength because we want the
trees to be bushier in order to decrease the height of the tree.
