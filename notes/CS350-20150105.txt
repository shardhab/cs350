An intractable dataset means that while you can compute it in practice,
in reality, it would take too long.

The recipe could be argued is not an algorithm because the steps are
not sufficiently precise and there is no set ending.

Algorithm definition:
-Each step must be unambiguous
-The algorithm must terminate
