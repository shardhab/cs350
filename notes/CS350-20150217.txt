AVL = left and right subtree differ by at most 1 (Mostly balanced)
Hashing works as well or better as AVL.

B-trees make database structure fast

Sometimes using less space makes the algorithm take less time too 
because there is less data to process.

To choose a data structure, look at other algorithms and what they 
use, look at tradeoffs. Make an educated guess.

Distribution Counting Sort:
Count the occurrences of each key.
Calculate the cumulative totals
